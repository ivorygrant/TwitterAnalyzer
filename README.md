# TwitterAnalyzer
A script that analyzes and visualizes a user's twitter feed

## Outstanding Items:
1. Fix tweet issue:
  create script that follows someone automatically once he/she follows you. The analysis won't run if the user is not already   friends. Tweet must show in my timeline. Also check mentions?
2. Deploy on heroku
3. Tweet times gap (millisecond time difference where tweets can go unnoticed)
4. being blitzed by calls, handle twitter API errors
  a. e.g. if 50 people tweet out, have a delay between each call as to not get kicked out (find out how many calls and/or results can be obtained by twitter)
5.
